# boids-simulation

This repository contains Python code to simulate flocking behavior using the Boids algorithm. It includes features for cohesion, alignment, and separation, allowing you to explore how boids interact in a flocking environment.

## Features
- Cohesion: Boids move towards the average position of their local flockmates.
- Alignment: Boids align their direction with the average direction of their local flockmates.
- Separation: Boids avoid crowding their local flockmates.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame
